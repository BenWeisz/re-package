# Project Support
For now we are only going to support very simple projects. Basically what that means is that we won't handle relative pathing in `#include` directives or even build tool include directory directives. Why you might ask? Well because the scope of this project is small and I really just need it to work for projects that I make on my spare time. Who knows, I may add support for systems like cmake down the line.
